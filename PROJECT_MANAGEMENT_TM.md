The so called "Project Management" of Ubinote


# Phase 1
- can create page, add highlight, and comments on HTML page
- simple login, setup flow

# Phase 2
- PDF

# Phase 3
- maybe follow links

Some note on design
- when users select text, automatically display a popup to whether highlight or add note
- Note display
  - It's best to display the note on the right of the whole text paragraph
  - but I guess since our app needs to be universal, then maybe only display note when user click on the highlight?
- starts with simple: add/delete no edit for now
- I think the hard stuff is how to have a component to wrap text that can trigger events? like the hyper-annotation from memex
