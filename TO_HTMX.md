Htmx is cool, and if it lives up to its promises, I can become a full-stack eng with just writing BE code.
So let's experiment with it.
Let's start small and work inside out
- the first one is to rewrite the home page to use htmx
- start from the link table, make it returns a table in html
- no need to change anything else, you can just use svelte to render raw html
- once that's done, you can start to convert the whole page
- the purpose is to learn how to work with htmx, after that we can do a whole refactor once we're more confidence
